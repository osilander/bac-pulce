# bac-pulce scripts
Methods for analysing Bac-PULCE data
Bac-PULCE data usually consist of a seet of fastq files that have been derived from Bac-PULCE nanopore run. In this run a large number of crRNAsareused to target and enrich specific regions or loci from sample (genomic, metagenomic, etc. These scripts then map the reads and create a setof figures, given the input reads and a genome to map to.
